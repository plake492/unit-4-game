there are two aspects of the game that I was unable to complete

1. I was not able to get the reset button to properly restart the game. 
    I waited untill the end to attempt to make a function that would reset the game and by
    that point, there was too much to try to reset. I should have created a function that I could easily 
    call back, but I would have had to develop the foundation upon that function instead of trying to 
    add it later.

2. I was unable to get the attack to increase by the characters attack value, instead, the vaule 
    just doubles after every attack. If each players attack was the same, this would be simple to fix, 
    I would sipmly add whatever number the attack value is after every attack. but since each character 
    has a different attack value, it was more complex.
